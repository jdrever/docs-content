Title: Data entry guidance

Its Species Dictionary follows Stace 3 reasonably closely, an update to Stace 4 names is planned. You may have to research synonyms to find the currently accepted name in the Species Dictionary.  </p><p>When you enter records, there may a few for which there is no direct equivalent in MapMate’s Species Dictionary.  Compile a list of these taxa and records and take them up with BSBI staff who will arrange to update the Species Dictionary via a MapMate patch.</p><p>Consult taxon referees on specimens and records of critical species, such as <em>Hieracium</em> and <em>Taraxacum</em>, before inputting these. This is especially important for old or historical records, even by reputable recorders, as there has been extensive revision of the taxonomy and our understanding of it in some of these critical groups in recent decades.  </p>"},"id":"769a7e53-bd4d-4649-a9b6-4f993fb30d26","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"<p><strong>Quantity</strong></p>"},"id":"8fc0adeb-2802-4eaa-b36c-e6065c1ac81e","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Enter population number or just “p” to indicate “Present” in MapMate.</p><p>For abundance, other than an exact number (“rare”, “scarce”, “widespread” etc), enter the details into the Comment field. </p><p>Use DAFOR where it has been assessed in the grid square that the grid ref describes. For example, if there is only one small bluebell wood in a tetrad then you might record bluebell as Rare. However, if you record the bluebell with a 10-figure grid reference then you might record it as abundant, even though it is the same group of bluebells.</p><p>It is good practice to qualify counts with descriptions such as <em>rosettes, spikes, clumps</em>, etc. If the quantity is followed by an exclamation mark and a qualifier in the Quantity field, e.g. 10!clumps, “clumps” will automatically appear in the Comments field.</p><p>To indicate an absence entry, enter ‘n’ in the abundance field. Always include a note in the Comments field to explain the area search and the reason that you consider the taxon to be absent. The grid-reference applied to an absence record should match the search area, e.g., use of a monad reference would indicate absence from that entire 1km square. </p>"},"id":"13ce9547-a703-419c-ab7f-22721c8557be","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"<p><strong>Stage</strong></p>"},"id":"fa1c7830-1ccb-4db4-9a8d-528e4aa21b81","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Only enter “Not recorded<em>”</em> if not recorded of course!  If the card says <em>seedling</em>, <em>juvenile,</em> <em>mature</em>, <em>flowering,</em> <em>fruiting</em> or <em>vegetative,</em> etc then it is useful to enter that.</p>"},"id":"cfc58e26-2e76-452c-81a5-96aa29e60a85","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"<p><strong>Sites</strong></p>"},"id":"bee8f69c-d50d-4ea4-9865-2da6c7ceb8c5","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p><strong>Always</strong> use a site name and a grid reference (grid ref).  This may allow errors to be identified and allows querying for occurrences of those site names.</p><p>A quick way to enter new sites in MapMate is to use the format “sitename@gridref” in the Site field.</p><p>However, if you use this quick way of entering sites, watch out if the site is near the VC boundary.  MapMate occasionally allocates the site to the wrong VC.  Partly because the base map that MM uses was digitised at a crude scale (1:200k), and the boundary can be 2 - 300 metres out.  Also, because for tetrad or 1km grid refs, if the centre of the square is outside the VC boundary MM tends to allocate the site to the other VC.</p><p>Use the most appropriate grid ref which (just) encompasses the site, e.g., a 6-figure grid ref describes a 100 m square or a 4-figure grid ref a 1 km square, etc., rather than central approximations of much larger sites (centroids).</p><p>Records from recent field recording should use at least 1 km precision grid references. Tetrad references should be avoided. BSBI no longer accepts new field records at worse than 2km precision, but historical data (before 2020) can still be entered at that scale.</p><p>Remember that site names are mainly useful only as a guide to support checking that the grid reference is correct – they should be <em>simple</em> and not precise address-like descriptions. Often the closest and most relevant name on a 1:50,000 (or better) map should be used.</p><p>With rivers &amp; road numbers, put a place name first then river or road, e.g., <em>Aberfeldy, River Tay</em> or <em>Crianlarich, A82</em>.</p><p>Always begin with the site name, followed by any <em>simple</em> <em>proximity </em>descriptors, using consistent formats. Then put other location information in Comments field.  For example, if you had noted “Rocks near shore, S of Kilmarie” on your recording card, you could enter “Kilmarie, S of” as the Site Name, and put “Rocks nr shore” in the Comments.</p><p>If your site name refers to a 1km or 2km square, rather than to a particular place in those squares, then you could include “1km square” or “2km square” after your site name.  Enter in the usual way.  E.g. in MapMate “Kilmadog (1km sq)@AB2367”.</p><p>Use your standard naming system and set of abbreviations consistently. Avoid using any ambiguous or non-standard abbreviations.</p><p>Although duplicate sites are not a serious problem as there is no limit to the number of sites you can create in MapMate, they are best avoided for tidiness.   You should minimise the number of duplicate sites by checking to see if the site already exists.  Enter its grid ref into the Site field, <em>enter</em> and use any suitable (pre-existing) site listed.</p><p>For newly recorded occurrences use the most precise grid ref possible – if you know the precise location then don’t just approximate to the nearest tetrad or monad.  Conversely, for imprecise data from other people then don’t try to make the record more precise than the information supplied by the recorder.</p><p>When digitising third party records which have grid references but no site names, and you have <em>no idea</em> where the site was then don’t add a site name retrospectively, as this may give false validity to any grid-reference errors.</p><p>It’s important not to try to second-guess the site details when entering someone else’s, perhaps old, data.  If in doubt, create a new site.  You can still query records for sites based on part of a site name, or for a 1 km square, tetrad or hectad, or within an irregular polygon drawn on screen.</p><p>Be cautious when editing site names of existing data. Don’t make changes just for the sake of consistency and neatness (unless, for example, spelling is obviously wrong). Such 'tidying up' of site names can inadvertently lead to a loss of valuable information, or even completely change the original meaning.</p><p><strong>Habitat information:</strong> If the entire site (100 m square, monad, tetrad etc.) has uniform habitat cover then details can be included in the Site details, otherwise best to include as a comment.<strong> </strong></p>"},"id":"a5cd7af6-addb-41d3-a727-19b4b60acc67","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"<strong>Date</strong>"},"id":"6e67129c-bba8-47ce-8ca3-912c726c14da","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Normally, the exact date will be given and should be entered in full.</p><p><strong>Only where exact dates are not given</strong>: use as narrow as possible date ranges, which should ideally avoid spanning BSBI date-classes.  (You can’t enter “before 1950” or “after 1970” etc. and must use date ranges). </p><p>Take care not to enter 2-digit years in MapMate, like “95” as this converts to 2095!</p>"},"id":"2391ae57-22c2-4121-9d92-818125be1185","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"<strong>Status</strong>"},"id":"42f6f0d2-cdc7-4851-a463-fd5409be8a18","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>(e.g.,<strong> </strong><em>Native, Alien,</em><strong> </strong><em>Planted,</em><strong> </strong><em>Established</em>, <em>Surviving, Casual, etc.)</em></p><p>If you use Status to record whether a species is <em>Native </em>(as opposed to <em>Alien</em>) then it should be applied at the level of the record, not the national or regional status of the taxon.</p><p>There is no need to record status when recording a native occurrence of a species in an area where it is by default native.

Long” are both fine, but please use one or other format consistently, rather than a mixture.</p><p>Whenever you enter a new recorder name for the first time, double-check that you have spelled it correctly, use ALL the recorder’s initials and get all the full-stops, spaces and commas in the right place and right order!
