This database holds records for all native and non-native vascular plants recorded in the wild across the whole of Britain and Ireland, mainly collected by our key volunteers – vice-county recorders (VCRs) - who collate these records voluntarily and provide the data to BSBI for mapping, research, conservation, and land management. Online access to this database is restricted to VCRs and their coworkers, BSBI staff, BSBI members (from 2024), researchers, and the staff of conservation and land management organisations with whom BSBI have agreements over the use of the data.

Often a good place to start are the species known to occur in the same habitat in the surrounding area. As described under 1, these data can be accessed via the (link: https://database.bsbi.org/maps/ text: maps on the website) or the (link: https://database.bsbi.org/reports/sitetaxa.php text: taxon list for a grid square tool on the DDb). We also provide (link: https://bsbi.org/wildflower-seed-sowing-pros-and-cons text: specific advice on the creation of wildflower meadows on our website).

","details":"As most research projects require bespoke datasets, we prefer to work with researchers to define their data needs and provide the data as one-off extracts. Where the research is funded BSBI would also expect to receive funding to cover the time to extract the data and help with any interpretation needed. Often this will vary from project to project and so it is best to contact the BSBI’s Head of Science prior to submitting grant proposals to discuss BSBI’s role and funding needs. Where the work is unfunded BSBI has a limited capacity to service data requests, but this will depend on the nature of the project and other priorities at the time the request is made. As stated above, all researchers should read the (link: https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/520609/1/N520609CR.pdf text: guidance on using BSBI occurrence records) prior to contacting us for data access to ensure they understand what BSBI data can and can’t be used for."},"id":"b6830912-7450-4ce0-beeb-2a5740c56457","isHidden":false,"type":"accordion"},{"content":{"summary":"7.\tI work for a commercial consultancy and need occurrence data to assess the impact of a development or land management activity","details":"We do not provide database access to commercial organisations but can provide one-off data extracts for a charge to cover staff time.
