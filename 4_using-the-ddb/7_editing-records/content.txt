This is to guard against mistakes in the editing process and to keep the history of changes  as clear as possible. Please edit records to correct mistakes, but only if the change is consistent  with the intent of the original recorder - otherwise reject the record instead. </p><p>The following types of change are often useful: </p><p><strong>Grid-reference </strong>mistakes that have occurred as a result of transcription or typing errors, or  which use the wrong grid-letter pair for an otherwise consistent site. If changing grid references,  site name or vice-county details, remember that different recorders may treat sites differently - a  site name might be the start point of a walk, a label for a whole tetrad or the centre point of a  wide-area survey. These may all be valid and you should not change details to suit your own  prefered usage. Another common type of mistake with older data sets is the use of SW monads  for tetrad data - there is an editing tool to correct these, but please seek advice if you are  planning to update a large batch of records. </p><p><strong>Vice-county </strong>errors that place a record more than 2km from the correct county (as determined  by a consistent site name and grid-reference). If a record doesn’t have a site name then it’s  often impossible to tell whether the specified county or grid-reference is at fault; please don’t  edit the county to match if this is the case. </p><p><strong>Recorder name </strong>mistakes, if you know with absolute certainty that the wrong recorder has been  assigned to a set of records. Do not edit records to change the format of an otherwise valid  name or to make a set of name variants consistent. </p><p>It can sometimes be useful to update the <strong>native status </strong>of occurrences that you know to have  been planted or deliberately introduced at a site. For example, a rare species may have been  planted in a new location as part of a species recovery programme. Otherwise, please do not  make any changes to record status as the BSBI is still working on a major revision of our guidelines on status. </p>"},"id":"f32aed7c-508d-4e11-b1ba-7c9216830fa4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Advanced editing"},"id":"a3d07d2d-8187-46e1-9f66-07e5bd7bdc93","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>There is an alternative way to modify all aspects of a record.
