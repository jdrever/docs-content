However, if you have yet to  attempt to validate records using the database, you might already have hundreds of thousands  of records for your vice-county (thank you!), so where to begin?  </p><p>Well, we have developed summary reports that highlight subsets of your data that would be worth  scrutinising more closely. These can be found by visiting your <a href=\"http://bsbidb.org.uk/mycounty.php\" title=\"My County page in DDb\">my county<em> </em>page</a> and clicking the  <strong>data validation</strong> tab.

As the header for the table explains, records are hidden on public&nbsp; maps (and will be excluded from the Atlas) if a grid-reference is further than 2km from the&nbsp; specified county.&nbsp;</li><li>A section titled <strong>Records to target for validation for Atlas 2020. </strong>These are your priority&nbsp; records for validation, split into three main categories: ‘Singletons’, ‘Rarities’ and ‘Possibly&nbsp; anomalous records’.

For example,  you might first concentrate on nationally rare and scarce species. Focus on finding records that  you feel are suspect, and mark them accordingly (see below). This will take them off the maps,  and you’ll then be able to delve deeper into such records at your (relative) leisure. Conversely, if  you consider a single unconfirmed hectad record of a rare or scarce species to be accurate, then  confirmation is useful. It is rare that you will need to reject a record, but if you do, be cautious and  only reject based on the details of the record, not the summary. </p><p>To validate a record: </p>"},"id":"8a531918-233a-4fb4-b12d-b2963d752dd5","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<ul><li>First click on a blue highlighted number within the priority species categories. This will&nbsp; bring up a search page. Press the <strong>display results</strong> tab to retrieve and view the list of&nbsp; records. The list can be resorted by clicking on the relevant header e.g. click on the taxon&nbsp; header to arrange species A-Z or Z-A. You can also sort by recorder, locality, grid ref,&nbsp; date, etc. in the same way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>At the bottom of the page, you will see a number of tabs, including <strong>select all</strong>, <strong>selected&nbsp;records action</strong> and <strong>mark validation state as</strong>. As you look through the list, pick out&nbsp; doubtful records and tick the box in the first column associated with the record. It’s usually&nbsp; best to work on small sets of records at a time, rather than the whole search results.&nbsp;</li><li>If you want the summary of a record, click on the validation symbol to the left of the pencil&nbsp;(edit) icon. If you find an error, try to understand how it happened – often you can see a&nbsp; pattern that can lead to other records with the same problem. For example, if you spot a&nbsp; site with a mistyped grid-reference (the <a href=\"http://www.cucaera.co.uk/grp/\" title=\"Cucaera website for grid reference checking\">cucaera website</a><u> </u>is helpful here), you’ll often find&nbsp; that a large set of records loaded at the same time that share the same mistake. Taxon&nbsp; mistakes may be the result of data entry errors – if you spot one such mistake then have&nbsp; a look to see if it was repeated more widely.&nbsp;</li><li>Once you’ve finished examining the list, check the relevant validation state in the <strong><em>mark&nbsp; validation state as</em></strong><em> </em>box, and click on <strong>apply change to selected records</strong>. You will be asked&nbsp; to give a brief explanation if you have marked records anything other than ‘confirmed’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>'Confirmed' implies that a record has been individually checked and that you are happy&nbsp; that it is likely to be valid. There is no need to confirm uncontroversial records and your&nbsp; priority should usually be to weed out mistakes instead.&nbsp;</li><li>Later in the validation process, you may wish to view only records that you have assigned&nbsp; to one particular validation state e.g. ‘needs verification’. You’ll notice that the search&nbsp; query page mentioned above includes a row titled ‘validation state’, which is set at&nbsp; ‘unclassified’ as the default. You can select a different validation state attached to records&nbsp; from the associated dropdown menu.</li></ul>"},"id":"e5f5f28c-8a62-463c-a6c9-efb2736c609a","isHidden":false,"type":"list"}],"id":"13c76685-01bf-4a8d-bc9b-427b71e39508","width":"1/1"}],"id":"0caf8994-77e2-44d2-8c34-3b6d407e5f9b"}]
