One good thing about backing up from the Replicator is that you can then upload your backup file to the MapMate server, in the same way that sync files can be uploaded, thus providing a secure off-site back-up location.</p><p>To run the internal back-up open the Replicator, go to the \"Special\" menu and choose “Backup your Database”. This will create a file called “[YourCUK]bakup.sqz” in the folder My MapMate\\Data\\Cache\\Upload. Having done, go to the Replicator’s “Sync” menu and choose Send Sync File ... To Web. This will allow you to upload your backup file to the MapMate webserver, from where you can download it if you ever need it. Each time you make a subsequent back-up using this process it will over-write the previous back-up.</p>"},"id":"9099b41e-a8d8-4abd-babe-6f08cfbea401","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"url":"https://youtu.be/0vnFTSBjEcw","caption":"Backing up from within MapMate video"},"id":"21c733bd-831c-4c33-918a-a04887da94fa","isHidden":false,"type":"video"},{"content":{"level":"h3","text":"Backing up by copying the MapMate folders (backs up everything including maps)"},"id":"6dce74be-70cc-4b33-a196-2a35d6bff31a","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>the Replicator’s internal back-up doesn't back-up your maps or user queries.
